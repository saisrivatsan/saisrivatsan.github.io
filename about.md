I am a Computer Science Fellow at [Harvard university](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I am a part of the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu). I'm currently working with [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister) on Vision and Learning for Connectomics.

Before coming to Harvard, I spent a year at [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) as a Research Fellow working with [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org) on large-scale multi-label learning.

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I did my undergraduate internship at [Computer Vision Lab, ETH Zurich](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Luc Van Gool](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/members/detail/1/). I was also an intern at [Video Analytics Lab](http://val.serc.iisc.ernet.in/valweb/index.html) at [CDS, IISc Bangalore](http://cds.iisc.ac.in).
